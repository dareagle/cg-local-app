# CG Local Application

This application should be used together with [cg-local-ext](https://github.com/jmerle/cg-local-ext). The application watches the selected file and sends the source code to the browser extension when the file is changed.

## Installation
1. Download the latest jar file from the [releases](https://github.com/jmerle/cg-local-app/releases) page.
2. Run the application with `java -jar <jar file>`, where `<jar file>` is the location of the jar file you just downloaded.
